Frozen is a theme for Sublime Text and Google Chrome DevTools. It was developed with the aim to be a theme with a modern look, congenial and never bores the views after hours coding.

The name "Frozen" was given due to the use of cool colors. The color palette used in this theme has been carefully selected to be comfortable to the eye and at the same time not lose the look of a text editor.

Start using Frozen now, and have a new experience in making codes.
