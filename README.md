## About

Frozen is a theme for Sublime Text and Google Chrome DevTools. It was developed with the aim to be a theme with a modern look, congenial and never bores the views after hours coding.

The name "Frozen" was given due to the use of cool colors. The color palette used in this theme has been carefully selected to be comfortable to the eye and at the same time not lose the look of a text editor.

Start using Frozen now, and have a new experience in making codes.

Unfortunately, after updating Google Chrome v32, compatibility with custom themes was lost. I'm working to fix that. 

If you want to meet the frozen, i have made available for download Google Chrome v31 Portable with frozen.
